<p>Given two strings s and t, determine if they are isomorphic.</p>

<p>Two strings s and t are isomorphic if the characters in s can be replaced to get t.</p>

<p>All occurrences of a character must be replaced with another character while preserving the order of characters. No two characters may map to the same character, but a character may map to itself.</p>
