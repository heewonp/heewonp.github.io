<p>Roman numerals are represented by seven different symbols: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">I</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">V</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">X</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">L</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">C</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">D</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">M</code>.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code> Symbol       Value
I             1
V             5
X             10
L             50
C             100
D             500
M             1000
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>For example, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">2</code> is written as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">II</code> in Roman numeral, just two oneâ€™s added together. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">12</code> is written as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">XII</code>, which is simply <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">X + II</code>. The number 27 is written as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">XXVII</code>, which is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">XX + V + II</code>.</p>

<p>Roman numerals are usually written largest to smallest from left to right. However, the numeral for four is not IIII. Instead, the number four is written as IV. Because the one is before the five we subtract it making four. The same principle applies to the number nine, which is written as IX. There are six instances where subtraction is used:</p>

<p>I can be placed before V (5) and X (10) to make 4 and 9. 
X can be placed before L (50) and C (100) to make 40 and 90. 
C can be placed before D (500) and M (1000) to make 400 and 900.
Given a roman numeral, convert it to an integer.</p>
